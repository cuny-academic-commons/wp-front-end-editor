## Front-end Editor (CAC fork)

This is a fork of [Front-end Editor](https://github.com/iseulde/wp-front-end-editor) that we maintain at the [CUNY Academic Commons](http://commons.gc.cuny.edu), primarily for use with our [Social Paper](https://github.com/cuny-academic-commons/social-paper) project.

This fork was made to address a few issues:
- [Remove button in floating image toolbar removes more than the image on subsequent clicks](https://github.com/iseulde/wp-front-end-editor/issues/266)
- [Toolbar does not show up](https://github.com/cuny-academic-commons/wp-front-end-editor/commit/7912523fa889456d4ec3ced793592f06c4c917f8)
- [Add a custom isDirty() method](https://github.com/cuny-academic-commons/social-paper/issues/71#issuecomment-156780590)
